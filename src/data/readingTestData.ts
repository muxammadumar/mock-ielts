            text: 'Open your eyes in sea water and it is difficult to see much more than a murky, bleary green colour. Sounds, too, are garbled and difficult to comprehend. Without specialised equipment humans would be lost in these deep sea habitats, so how do fish make it seem so easy? Much of this is due to a biological phenomenon known as electroreception \u2013 the ability to perceive and act upon electrical stimuli as part of the overall senses. This ability is only found in aquatic or amphibious species because water is an efficient conductor of electricity.',

            text: 'Electroreception comes in two variants. While all animals (including humans) generate electric signals, because they are emitted by the nervous system, some animals have the ability \u2013 known as passive electroreception \u2013 to receive and decode electric signals generated by other animals in order to sense their location. Other species are capable of generating their own enhanced electric signals. This ability \u2013 known as active electroreception \u2013 enables them to sense objects in their environment by detecting disturbances in the electric field they themselves have created.',

            text: 'The discovery of electroreception dates back to 1678, when the Italian physician Stefano Lorenzini described small gel-filled pores on the heads and snouts of sharks, though he had no idea what their function was. It was not until 1960 that the biologist R.W. Murray confirmed that these pores \u2013 now known as the ampullae of Lorenzini \u2013 were electroreceptors capable of detecting weak electric fields produced by prey animals. This finding was a major breakthrough in understanding how sharks could locate prey even in complete darkness or buried under sand.',

            text: 'Sharks are perhaps the best-known electroreceptive animals. They can detect electric fields as weak as 5 nanovolts per centimetre \u2013 that is 5/1,000,000,000 of a volt. This extraordinary sensitivity allows them to locate prey that is completely hidden from sight and from other senses. The ampullae of Lorenzini are concentrated around the shark\'s head, particularly on the snout, and they work by detecting voltage differences between the seawater and the gel inside the ampullae. When a shark swims near a fish or other animal, the electrical activity of that animal\'s muscles creates a tiny electric field that the shark can pick up.',

These fish have evolved specialised organs \u2013 known as electric organs \u2013 that generate weak electric fields around their bodies. By sensing distortions in these fields, the fish can navigate through murky water, find food, and communicate with each other. The electric organ is typically found in the tail region and consists of modified muscle cells called electrocytes that produce an electric discharge.',

Some scientists are developing underwater robots that mimic the electroreceptive abilities of fish, which could be used for ocean exploration, detecting underwater mines, or monitoring water quality. Others are studying how electroreception might inspire new types of sensors for medical diagnosis. Understanding how animals process electrical information could also lead to advances in prosthetic limb design, giving amputees a sense of touch through artificial electroreceptors.',

The first timekeeping devices were based on natural phenomena: the movement of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the changing seasons. The sundial, one of the oldest known instruments for measuring time, works by casting a shadow on a marked surface as the sun moves. Evidence of sundials dates back to ancient Egypt around 1500 BCE, though simpler shadow-based devices were likely used even earlier.',

It measured time by the regulated flow of water from one container to another. Water clocks were used in ancient Greece, Rome, China, and the Islamic world. They had the advantage of working at night and on cloudy days when sundials were useless, though their accuracy was limited by variations in water temperature and pressure.',

The earliest mechanical clocks, dating from the late 13th century, used a system of weights and gears to measure time. These clocks were large, expensive, and often installed in church towers or public buildings. The invention of the pendulum clock by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 dramatically improved accuracy, reducing timekeeping errors from about 15 minutes per day to just 15 seconds.',

The quartz clock, introduced in 1927, used the vibrations of a quartz crystal to keep time with extraordinary precision. This technology eventually became so affordable that it could be incorporated into wristwatches, making accurate timekeeping accessible to everyone. The development of the atomic clock in 1955 pushed accuracy even further, using the vibrations of cesium atoms to measure time to within one second in millions of years.',

Before reliable marine chronometers were developed in the 18th century, sailors had no accurate way to determine their longitude \u2013 their east-west position on the globe. This led to numerous shipwrecks and navigational disasters. The English clockmaker John Harrison spent decades developing increasingly accurate marine timepieces, eventually creating a watch that could determine longitude to within half a degree.',

In 1884, an international conference established Greenwich, England, as the prime meridian, creating the system of time zones still used today.

            text: 'Despite its promise, vertical farming faces substantial challenges. The energy required to power LED lights and climate control systems means that vertical farms have high operating costs, and their carbon footprint depends heavily on the source of electricity. If powered by fossil fuels, a vertical farm may actually produce more emissions than conventional agriculture. The industry must therefore be paired with renewable energy sources to achieve its environmental goals. Additionally, the high initial capital investment and the limited range of crops that can be grown economically \u2013 mostly leafy greens and herbs \u2013 raise questions about scalability and economic viability.',
